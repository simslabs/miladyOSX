# My Dress Up Milady
An avant-cozy wardrobe for Milady community assets. Front end is built using postmodern web standards and vanilla ice cream sandwiches. All assets used in this network experience are permanently uploaded to the [Shadow Drive](https://shdw.genesysgo.com/), a (soon-to-be) decentralized storage system built leveraging Solana's Proof of History consensus. 

Special thank yous to the teams behind [Milady](https://twitter.com/miladymaker), and [Milady Aura](https://twitter.com/miladyauras) for adopting the CC0 license and making their assets easily accessible.

## Motivation
Dressing up and making memes with your Milady is a self-rewarding experience. All Milady deserve to have equal access to quality, customizable Milady assets. Additionally, since this repository will be open sourced, it can serve as a resource for future creativity. Both for Milady users and developers, as well as aspiring NFT utility creators.

In order to allow users ease of customization, all assets need to be on separate layers. Top Milady Researchers were able to extract the secret formula that ensures a properly set up Milady.
