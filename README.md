# My Dress Up Milady :kimono:
An avant-cozy wardrobe for Milady community assets. Front end is built using postmodern web standards and vanilla ice cream sandwiches. All assets used in this network experience are permanently uploaded to the [Shadow Drive](https://shdw.genesysgo.com/), a (soon-to-be) decentralized storage system built leveraging Solana's Proof of History consensus. 

Special thank yous to the teams behind [Milady](https://twitter.com/miladymaker), and [Milady Aura](https://twitter.com/miladyauras) for adopting the Viral Public License and making their assets easily accessible. 

Once the main Milady section and Aura assets have been fully implemented, the team will expand to offer other Milady ecosystem project assets and meme creation features with the following planned priorities in order from highest to lowest:
- Features:
  - Clip art pasting 
  - Top/bottom text
  - Import your own layers
  - Crop/resizing
  - Milady Diffusion 
- Milady Derivatives:
  - Bored Milady Maker
  - Pixelady Maker
  - Redacted Remilio Babies
  - Tubby Milady Maker
  - Milady Rave
  - Tojiba CPU Corp
  - Tojiba Disc Buddies
  - milAIdy maker

## Motivation :womans_hat:
Dressing up and making memes with your Milady is a self-rewarding experience. All Milady deserve to have equal access to quality, customizable Milady assets. Additionally, since this repository will be open sourced, it can serve as a resource for future creativity. Both for Milady users and developers, as well as aspiring NFT utility creators. 


## Reverse-Engineering :yarn:
A more detailed description about the overall design process of Milady Maker can be found [here](https://goldenlight.mirror.xyz/aSbBpC_h07_a5DJA3mXAiclE4VF7UpQUhPbIpGg6iWo). In order to allow users ease of customization, all assets need to be on separate layers. Top Milady Researchers were able to extract the secret formula that ensures a properly set up Milady.
